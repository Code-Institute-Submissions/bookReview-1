## UX
This website has the potential to reach a large market, both young and old people who like to read. It's both simple and aesthetically pleasing, as well as easy to navigate around. The main page has a call to action, for the user to register to the site. If the user is already registered, there is a link under the register form, which will bring the user to the login page. 
Once the user has registered or logged in, they will be directed to their own profile which will be created for them and will show a welcoming message. On their profile page, the user will be shown text with the number of books they have reviewed versus the books actually reviewed, the profile page will also have their review displayed. For users who have only registered, they can navigate easily to the "Write Review" tab which will bring them to a form, where they can write their review.
When the user writes the review, a successful message will flash before them to confirm. The user can then view the nicely laid out book reviews by navigating to the "book review" page.
